Block-a-Day #5. Experiment with using patterns and animation to show the margin of error on a choropleth. Stripes periodically pulse to the extremes of the margin of error to show uncertainty. This is one where the only way to see if it works is to build it; unfortunately, the idea worked better in my imagination.

**Data Sources:** 2014 ACS

**What I Learned:** I might have used an SVG mask before in a visualization project, but I had certainly never used the combination of pattern and mask. Drew heavily upon [John Schulz's block](http://bl.ocks.org/jfsiii/7772281) demonstrating this technique. This is also my first time using Mike Bostock's pattern for [chained transitions](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/70d5541b547cc222aa02).

**What I'd Do With More Time:** Not sure. This isn't as effective as I'd hoped. Might be a dead end.

## Block-a-Day

Just what it sounds like. For fifteen days, I will make a [D3.js v4](https://d3js.org) block every single day. Rules:

1. Ideas over implementation. Do something novel, don't sweat the details.
2. No more than two hours can be spent on coding (give or take).
3. Every. Single. Day.
